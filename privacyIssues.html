					<h2>How long can a company keep your data?</h2>

					<p>Well, it depends on the country you're in. In the UK a company can hold your data for up to 12 months. Unless, 
					the law requires them to hold on to it for more.

				<div class = "article">
					<h2>Who gets to see the data?</h2>

					<p>Companies are not allowed to disclose someone’s private data. They are required by the law to keep it safe. 
					Some companies like to use third parties to process the data and if they wish to do so these third parties are 
					required to keep the data safe as well. 
					</p>

				<div class = "article">
					<h2>What are your rights?</h2>

					<p>You have the right to ask a company or organisation to delete all your data. You also have the right to amend 
					your data and the right to refuse your data being processed.

					<h2>What is the amount of remote attacks that businesses face?</h2>

					<h2>How to protect yourself from those attacks if you’re working individually or with a business ? (Aztechit.co.uk, 2021)
					</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>You need to protect your business with the right security software - invest in solutions such as Endpoint Detection 
						& Response that alerts you to any changes in your network, allowing your IT team to investigate and remove risks before 
						they damage, infect, or steal your data.
						</li>
						<li>Keeping your systems secure and preventing data privacy issues at the enterprise level can be expensive. But, the 
						costs of a data breach are so significant, you need to bite the bullet and invest properly. (Cloverdx, 2020)
						</li>
						<li>Data privacy breaches are often caused by poorly managed access within an organisation. People and processes 
						matter as much as technology. Humans are the weakest link in the chain of privacy and security. However, as 
						distributed working proliferates, it’s harder to manage user access and secure your sensitive data. To remedy 
						this, you need an effective data architecture and strong data governance processes. (Cloverdx, 2020)
						</li>
					</ul>
