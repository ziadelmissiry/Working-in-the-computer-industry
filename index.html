					<h2>What is cyber security? </h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime.</li>
						<li>Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), 
						and the services we access online - both at home and work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorised 
						access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>What are the dangers? </h2>

					<p>From banking to shopping, and streaming to social media, people are spending more time than ever online.
					</p>

					<p>This means more opportunities for hackers to carry out cyber attacks. They often do this by targeting people and 
					businesses using:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Email and website scams.</li>
						<li>Malware - software that can damage your device or let a hacker in</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If hackers get into your device or accounts, they could access your money, your personal information, or information 
					about your business.</p>
				</div>

				<div class = "article">
					<h2>Why should you care?</h2>

					<p>39% of businesses and 26% of charities last year reported being victims of cyber attacks or security breaches, 
					and believe it or not those numbers are down slightly from previous years. This shows that if cyber criminals have 
					the morality to attack charitable organisations, then they certainly won't hesitate to steal your personal information 
					or scam you for your hard-earned money.</p>
