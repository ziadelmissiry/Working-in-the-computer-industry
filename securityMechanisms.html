			<h2>Security mechanisms to protect information systems:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Lock the screen when you're away from the desk</li>
				<li>Securing your Wifi and not connecting to public wifi</li>
				<li>Only keep the data that you need</li>
				<li>Installing malware protection or antivirus</li>
				<li>Don't let anyone access your system and reach your data</li>
				<li>Don't open emails that look suspicious like phishing emails</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Always use a different and the strongest password for your email since it gives access to all your other social platforms and data (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2022)
				If someone has access to your email, he can:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Access private information like bank details</li>
					<li>Send messages and emails pretending to be you to scam other people using your name</li>
					<li>Get access to all other online and social platforms and change their passwords</li>

				</ol>

				<p>If you have re-used your email password across other accounts, change your email password as soon as possible. It should be strong and different to all your other accounts (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2022).</p>

				<p>If your device has been locked or infected with ransomware, don't pay them money or else you’ll be a true victim to those criminals. Paying them is a huge mistake because you’ll be targeted in the future and your device will still be infected even though you already paid. Also, there is no guarantee that paying the money will get you access to your data or your computer.
				</p>

				<h2>What should I do if my computer has been infected ? (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2022)
				</h2>

				<ol>
					<li>Open your antivirus product and run a scan, then follow its advice</li>
					<li>If your AV can’t clean your device up – you’ll have to wipe it entirely and reinstall everything, starting with your operating system. You may need to get expert help to do this</li>
				<li>If you cannot download and install an antivirus product because your web browser (eg Chrome, Edge, Firefox) is infected, you will probably need to get expert help.</li>
				<li>Restore your backed-up data from the 'last known' good backup.</li>
			</ol>
