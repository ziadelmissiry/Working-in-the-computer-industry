					<h2>Staying informed</h2>

					<p>As of February 2022 the NCSC has received over 10 million reported scams. (Ncsc.gov.uk, 2022)</p>
					
					<p>Ensuring you are staying on top of all of the newest threats to your cyber security is very important. 
					One example of this is being aware of any recent data breaches within companies that have access to your personal 
					data such as email addresses, phone numbers etc. There are even websites with tools you can use to check if your 
					email address was involved in any data breaches (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a> for example), and if there are 
					any listed there that you are unaware of then it is recommended that you change your password and be cautious of 
					any unexpected emails that are sent to that address.</p>

					<h2>What is the best way to stay safe online?</h2>

					<p>There is a well known saying amongst computer enthusiasts that goes “the best antivirus is common sense”. 
					Which is very true, because once you are aware of the possible threats and know what to look out for then it 
					is very easy to avoid your computer being infected with some form of malware. Usually this ‘common sense’ includes 
					things such as not downloading files from suspicious sources and being aware that when something seems too good to 
					be true, it almost certainly is.</p>
